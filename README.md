# Churn-Analysis-Telecomindustry-data
Figuring out Which Customer May leave from Telecom-Industry using machine learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Also Comparing the Model against Each other to find out the Best Suitable Model
Understanding the problem to Figure out which customer may leave the Telecom industry considering various features and their Importance
To understand the Deeper roots of the data and their features(How they behave) we have to do a very good Exploratory Data Analaysis & Visualizations.
Data Preprcoessing is very necessary before proceeding to Train our Model removing the unnecessary and irrelevant data(Messy data) from the data sets and making the data ready for Training
Splitting the Data in to 70:30 Train-Test for our model building and Validation or Test data
Then we Train our First Model using Logistic Regression find out the accuracy,Recall,precision and other statistical value.
The next model we train with the Random Forest just cross verify whether it gives better result than Logistic Regression or not.
After Training the Machine Learning Models then we proceed further for the Deep Learning with One Layer and Multiple Hidden Layer Models.
In This Deep learning Model we have also set callbacks,Early stoppage for the best results and the best Model automatically gets Saved once it gets the best accuracy and Lowest Validation Loss
The data was Quite complicated but we have got a very best model with all the Statistics
We have completed doing Machine Learning + Deep Learning Model with this data set
